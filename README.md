# Showcase

This is an old repository of mine which contains all kinds of programs. My name is Tuomas Myllym√§ki and I live in southern Finland.
If you're an employer please also check out my newer [repositories](https://github.com/UrjalaCoder/). As I said, **this is mainly old stuff**. I'm a first-year computer science student at Aalto university. I have some hobby experience but no actual job experience. Though I'm eager to learn!
**I'm looking for a summer job for the summer of 2019. Please contact me if you're interested in hiring me.**

# Sim
In the folder titled 'Sim' you find a gravity simulation made with HTML and Javascript.

# Project_Omega
In this folder there's a gravity simulation made with Python and Tkinter

# Machine Learning-AI
This folder contains different machine learning and AI algorithms. The file "graphics.py" is not made by me but other files in this
folder use it to draw simple graphics for visualization. The files in this folder usually require numpy and matplotlib libraries to work. Latest versions should work OK.

# Algorithms
This folder contains Python implementations of some famous algorithms. The sub-folders Matrix_Multiplication and Sorting contain algorithms related to their respective subjects.

# Python_simple
This folder contains simple python scripts. They usually contain a class with a specific purpose.
