# Showcase

This is the showcase of Tuomas Myllym√§ki. Main language is Python. If you're an employer please contact me if you find my stuff interesting, I'm looking for a summer job for the summer of 2019. I live in Espoo, Finland.

I'm a first-year computer science student at Aalto university. I have some hobby experience but no actual job experience. Though I'm eager to learn!

# Sim
In the folder titled 'Sim' you find a gravity simulation made with HTML and Javascript.

# Project_Omega
In this folder there's a gravity simulation made with Python and Tkinter

# Machine Learning-AI
This folder contains different machine learning and AI algorithms. The file "graphics.py" is not made by me but other files in this
folder use it to draw simple graphics for visualization. The files in this folder usually require numpy and matplotlib libraries to work. Latest versions should work OK.

# Algorithms
This folder contains Python implementations of some famous algorithms. The sub-folders Matrix_Multiplication and Sorting contain algorithms related to their respective subjects.
